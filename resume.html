            Hi, my name is <strong>Gerard Gorlero</strong> and I am a retail store lead at Dick's Sporting Goods. I enjoy the work that I do and always put in maximum effort in what I do
            in order to achieve success. My interest include staying active daily, learning new skills and finances. My dream job is to become a software developer 
            in the near future and is what I am currently learning when I am not working. I do go to school for it,
            but also going the self-taught route when not in class to sharpen my skills in order to succeed in this competitive field.
            I currently work full-time and go to school full-time at <em>Long Beach City College</em>. 
        </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned, I am teaching myself how to code using free online programs such as The Odin Project and Free Code Camp. Simutaneously, I am enrolled in Long Beach
                City College's Web Development program to earn an associates degree. I believe in doing both paths because they'll compliment each other in the long-run,
                though I'll be putting in long hours in the day. I will also be working on projects like working websites using HTML/CSS and Java script in order to display
                my skill for potental employers and will be listed below. Listed below are my projects and profiles to the work I have done with sites such as Free Code Camp.

            Why Coding?
        </h2>
        <hr class="why-line">
        <p>
            My interest has always been in the technology industry, I love hardware and software and it is a big part of my life. Some of my favorite websites I use on
            a daily basis are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube.</a> I only found out recently I really enjoyed front-end work because 
            it involves being creative in making software and I have always enjoyed different forms of art. My career goal is to be a UX designer because I have always noticed how an app or platform navigates
            before even noticing its content. It never fails, whenever I am using something like Netflix or maybe Instagram, I am always seeing how UI functions and thinking of ways of improving
            it if possible, or analyzing some the clever ways these large tech companies enhance the user experience of an app. Another goal that works alongside my previous one is doing free lancing
            work like making websites for people. I like helping people, and free lance work can fulfill that interest because people pay for freelance work to cheaply enhance whatever goal they're
            trying to achieve like create an online business and I am for that. I am very goal-oriented and I have written down milestone I'd like to achieve to reach my goal.
